# Confidence_Interval_for_fWAR
## An attempt to find a confidence interval for position player fWAR
  This project is an attempt to compute, what ended up being, a 94% confidence interval for fWAR. The data used is the full fangraphs.com batting leaders data set from 1967 to 2017 with no PA minimum and no team splits. Also, to get full player careers, I had to get rid of all non-1967-rookies from the data. For that, I used the fangraphs.com "Custom Table" option to get just names of rookies in 1967. 
The conclusion of this project is that position player fWAR has a 94% confidence interval of +/- 0.87.
